This is a landing page of the Dia. There're header with menu, navigation, main title and slider; main block with some sections presenting information about company, job types and reviews of the clients. The page also has footer with contacts, social media links, form, logo and navigation.

I used such technologies as HTML, CSS, Sass, BEM to create this landing page.
